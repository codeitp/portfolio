# Personal Portfolio

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## About the Project

This project is my personal portfolio, showcasing my skills, projects, and experiences as a developer. It is designed to provide visitors with an overview of my work, highlight my technical expertise, and serve as a platform to connect with potential collaborators or employers.

The portfolio is built using Next.js for its performance and modern web development features, ensuring a fast and seamless user experience.

## Hosted on Render

This portfolio is hosted on [Render](https://render.com). You can view it live at [Portfolio Link](#). *(To Update the link once hosted.)*

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
