# Personal Portfolio

## About the Project

This is my personal portfolio, designed to highlight my work, showcase selected projects, and reflect my professional experience in software development. The site provides a clean, responsive interface that guides visitors through my background, expertise, and notable achievements.

It serves as both a personal branding platform and a central hub for potential collaborators, employers, or anyone interested in my work.

You can view the portfolio live at: [Portfolio Link](https://patroba-oteko.onrender.com/)
